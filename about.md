# About

Welcome to the Sy Schiff Art Archive. After Sy's death in January 2021, we began the project of digitizing and preserving his artwork for his family, his friends, and the public. This site was created as a digital repository of his work.

A lifetime's worth of creative output takes a long time to process, and so far we have barely begun. This site will be updated regularly with new content as new work becomes available, so please check back for updates! 

Questions? We would love to hear from you. Feel free to say hello at [hello@syschiff.art](mailto:hello@syschiff.art).
