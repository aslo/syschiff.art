## About Sy
Seymour (Sy) Schiff was a husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather. Though he only made art as a hobby, throughout his life he produced hundreds of artworks across a number of mediums including pastels, painting, wood carving, and woodblock printing. 

Sy was also an avid birdwatcher and a fixture in the Long Island birding community. His love of the outdoors is reflected in his art, which frequently depicts beaches, birds, and the nature preserves along the south shore of Long Island. In addition, all of his woodwork is comprised of driftwood that he salvaged while walking the beach.

## About This Site
After Sy's death in January 2021, his family began the daunting project of digitizing and preserving his artwork. This site was created by his grandchildren as a digital repository of his work so that it could be shared with the public.

A lifetime's worth of creative output takes a long time to process, and so far we have barely begun. This site will be updated regularly as new work becomes available, so please check back for updates!
